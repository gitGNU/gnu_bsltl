@top Introduction

The BSLTL package is a free collection of OCTAVE/MATLAB routines for working with the
biospeckle laser technique.(version @value{VERSION}).

Implemented technics:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Graphical methods: Fujii, GD, Std, Mean, Contrast, PTD, MHI, Kurtosis, Skewness, etc.
@c @math{FUJII=\frac{200}{NTIMES-1} \sum \limits_{k=1}^{NTIMES-1} \frac{|I_{k}-I_{k+1}|}{I_{k}+I_{k+1}}} 
@c @math{GD=\frac{1}{\binom{NTIMES}{2}} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{NTIMES-1} \sum\limits_{l=1}^{NTIMES-k} |I(k)-I(k+l)|} 
@c @math{Mean= \frac{1}{NTIMES} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{NTIMES} I(k) \approx E[I(k)]} 
@c @math{Std = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{NTIMES} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{NTIMES} (I(k)-Mean)^2  }} 

@item
Numerical methods: AVD, IM, NCOM, THSP, RVD, Corr, etc.
@c @math{AVD=\sum \limits_{ij} NCOM(i,j)|i-j|} 
@c @math{IM=\sum \limits_{ij} NCOM(i,j)|i-j|^2}

We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating BSLTL package, please 
cite it when using it.  See also `citation pkgname' for citing other Octave 
package with pkgname name.

@node Dependencies
@chapter Dependencies

@section Octave dependencies
Some functions inside BSLTL package depend of signal package;
at the same time the signal package depends of control package.
Thus, we recommend install first the control package and later the signal package
with the following online OCTAVE installation commands.
@example
pkg install -forge control
pkg install -forge signal
@end example
@cindex Dependencies of Octave-Forge

In operating systems based in GNU/Linux can be necessary install first the 
library @code{liboctave-dev} in the system, given that OCTAVE uses this library 
to install the control package. The next code is an example (Ubuntu/Debian) of 
command install in the system.

@verbatim
sudo apt-get install liboctave-dev
@end verbatim

@node Installation
@chapter Installtion


@section Method 1: Online - Only in OCTAVE
@cindex Method 1
The next OCTAVE code, install the last version of BSLTL package directly from 
octave-forge website in the default install directory.
@example
pkg install -forge -auto bsltl
@end example
With this method the package is configured for be loaded automatically when OCTAVE start.

@section Method 2: Offline - Only in OCTAVE
@cindex Method 2
The next OCTAVE code, install the BSLTL package, 
@url{http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bsltl/, bsltl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}, 
in the directory: ~/lib/octmat

If the BSLTL package was downloaded in the directory: /download_path
@example
pkg prefix ~/lib/octmat
pkg install -auto /download_path/bsltl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
@end example
With this method the package is configured for be loaded automatically when OCTAVE start.

@section Method 3: Offline - In MATLAB or OCTAVE
@cindex Method 3
If the BSLTL package, @url{http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bsltl/, bsltl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}, 
was uncompressed in the directory '/home/user/lib/octmat/bsltl'. 
For that this package can be used by a source file, it needs add the next code 
in the top of source file.
@example
BSLTL_DIR='/home/user/lib/octmat/bsltl';
addpath(genpath(BSLTL_DIR));
@end example
The function genpath generates a list with the directories and sub directories.
The function addpath add directories to OCTAVE system path.

In this method we install (add to  Octave system path) the BSLTL package each 
time that we call our source files.

@chapter Using the BSLTL package

Many code examples  can be found in the @url{http://www.nongnu.org/bsltl, homepage}
of BSLTL library.

@section Example code of method 1 and 2 - Getting the AVD value of line 240
@cindex Method 1
@cindex Method 2
@example
IMAGES_DIR = '/home/user/data/speckle/test1';

DATA = datapack(IMAGES_DIR,'img',1,129,'bmp'); % Datapack of 129 images.
                                               % 'img1.bmp', 'img2.bmp', 
                                               % ...       , ...       ,
                                               % 'img128.bmp', 'img129.bmp'.

THSP = thsp(DATA,'line',240);   % Getting the time history speckle pattern.
COM  = coom(THSP);              % Getting the co-occurrence matrix.
AVD  = avd(COM);                % Getting the AVD value.
@end example

@section Example code of method 3 - Getting the AVD value of column 100
@cindex Method 3
@example
BSLTL_DIR = '/home/user/lib/octmat/bsltl';
addpath(genpath(BSLTL_DIR));

IMAGES_DIR = '/home/user/data/speckle/test1';

DATA = datapack(IMAGES_DIR,'img',1,129,'bmp'); % Datapack of 129 images.
                                               % 'img1.bmp', 'img2.bmp', 
                                               % ...       , ...       ,
                                               % 'img128.bmp', 'img129.bmp'.

THSP = thsp(DATA,'column',100); % Getting the time history speckle pattern.
COM  = coom(THSP);              % Getting the co-occurrence matrix.
AVD  = avd(COM);                % Getting the AVD value.
